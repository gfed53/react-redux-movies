# Movie App (Front End: React/Redux)

This repo contains the front end of the project. For deployment, I plan to transfer the contents of this repo into a different repo, react-django-movies, where the front end will connect to a Django back end which will handle user accounts and a simple API proxy for our calls to the TMDB API.

For now, the Django app this front end connects to is in a separate, private repo that I plan on sharing in the future. To be clear, this app will *not* function without a back end.
